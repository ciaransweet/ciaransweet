![Me talking about Mangroves](https://github.com/ciaranevans/ciaranevans/blob/main/mangroves.jpg?raw=true)

Hi there! My name's Ciaran (_That's me_ ☝️)
I'm an Engineer based in Bristol in the UK 🇬🇧

Right about now I'm an Engineering Manager @ [Snowfall](https://snowfalltravel.com/)

Previously I've worked @ [Xydus](https://xydus.com/), [Reliably](https://reliably.com/), [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org), and the [UKHO](https://www.admiralty.co.uk/) doing product, data, and general software engineering!

Some cool projects I've personally worked on include:

* Maintaining [Chaos Toolkit](https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit) 🔥
* Making NASA's Sentinel-2 imagery fetching pipeline [serverless](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/hls-sentinel2-downloader-serverless) 🛰
* Helping Pangeo Forge provide [scalable compute](https://github.com/ciaranevans?from=2021-07-01&to=2021-07-12&org=pangeo-forge&year_list=1) to scientists 🧑‍🔬
* Scaling a deep learning model across **The Globe** and [finding mangroves](https://medium.com/uk-hydrographic-office/creating-a-global-dataset-using-serverless-applications-and-deep-learning-c4e267fa810c?source=friends_link&sk=37ab5a146ad07c93afa63382fa44ad67) 🌍🌱


Some of my tech passions are:
* Building serverless infrastructure with IaC (AWS CDK, Terraform)
* Making kick ass CI/CD pipelines and processes (GitHub Actions ❤️)
* Making software people love to use (or data they love to look at!)
* Skilling up alongside my peers with good agile practices, pairing, and thoughtful code reviews!
